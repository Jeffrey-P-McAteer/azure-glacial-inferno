Management utility for the `azure-glacial-inferno` server.

Does not perform maitenence, but does warn/syslog about anomolies and re-starts anything out of line (disconnected network, drive mounts, whatever.).


## Azure-Glacial-Inferno design

 - Arch Linux
 - BTRFS root drive
 - 32-or-so-GB swap
 - SSH server
 - NginX w/ user certs
    - How dynamic can we make this? a `/agi-users/` folder of `.pem` files?
 - Xpra behind nginx
    - One session per user cert under `/agi-users/`
    - For the GUI... ~~KDE~~ LXQt! https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LXQt
 - Also, run a mumble server for all connected users: https://www.mumble.info/
    - User voice in/over, plus bg/shared music player (submit .mp3 files, YT urls, etc)
    - Can we enable audio out on login?
    - Also possibly some desktop GUI to render speaker icons?
 - user cert-ed WebDAV server for users to move files around
